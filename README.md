If you have restarted the server and a reply chain has been ongoing for a while, it will take a long time to build the reply chain initially as message retrieval is relatively time-consuming. Once fetched, they are cached in memory for faster subsequent messages https://gist.github.com/qiqiting/3ca286a68659a0fcf7aca829e2605f00\n\n## Endpoint /models - GET\n\nThis will return a list of models in the model directory\n\nResponse\n```
